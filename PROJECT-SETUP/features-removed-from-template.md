# NOTE TO SELF

I removed some 2 features from the boilerplate, because I don't know how to use them (yet!)  
-> Github Workflows;
-> Pre-Commit.

See initial commit to have an example of how to implement/use these features
(or the original template repo from amegakure -> https://github.com/amegakure-studio/cairo-template)
